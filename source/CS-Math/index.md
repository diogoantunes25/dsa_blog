# Draft

- This is an instance of the Feynman technique - I use this space to take step 2 and 4 of the 
Feynman technique.

- I do this for myself. Despite that the level at which one is able to comprehend what I here explain
is a direct reflection of how well I understood the subject. Thus don't hesitate in contacting me in case
some doubt comes up - I always like to discuss subjects I love. Besides that I also love writing so all
constructive feedback is very much welcome.

- I have recently bought a table along with a pen. Since then my note taking has become fully digital.
The articles on this section are about selected topics (there's no strict criteria) - I'll try to tag 
them appropriately. 

- However I hand write texts about practically all the subjects I study (from CS to Maths to Physics).
Even though my hand writing is barely legible, I'll leave links to this texts in case it interests someone.
(the difference to the articles it's 1) the handwriting and 2) the refinement level is different).

- Why written texts and not videos - 1) like writting 2) think being able to read text is crucial skill
